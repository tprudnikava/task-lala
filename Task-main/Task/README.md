This repository contains two separate implementations of the same UI task.

## Branches

- swiftui-implementation — SwiftUI version
- uikit-implementation — UIKit version

## Requirements

Images carousel: when user swipe left or right, list content should change accordingly. The images carousel can handle any number of images.
The list: when user scrolls up the whole page should scroll with it. The list can handle any number of items. 
P.S. images and list content can be local or loaded from the internet.
Search: Search bar should pin top when it reaches screen top. When user enter text, it should filter the labels in the list based on the user input.
Floating action button should show a nice bottom sheet dialog that contain a small statistic that consist of the count of items for each page and show the top 3 occurrence character in the list. i.e
listOf(“apple”, “banana” , “orange”,“blueberry”)
List 1 (4 items)
a = 5
e = 4
r = 3
Don’t use third party libraries
Implement the requirements using both SwiftUI & UIKit, each implementation should be pushed to a separate git branch.
